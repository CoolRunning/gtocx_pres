## About GTOC-X

GTOC stands for Global Trajectory Optimization Competition, a (bi)-annual event where experts from mathematics and astrodynamics are competing to optimize a nearly impossible to solve interplanetary trajectory problem. GTOC-X has been the 10th edition of this competition, organized by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL/NASA). The problem for this edition was to settle the galaxy within 90 Million years, making use of interstellar travel.

I participated together with my team at ESA and we were able to score the 3rd place, competing with 73 teams. This presentation was created to present our solution strategies at the [Astrodynamics Specialist Conference](http://space-flight.org/docs/2019_summer/2019_summer.html) 2019, in Portland, Maine.
